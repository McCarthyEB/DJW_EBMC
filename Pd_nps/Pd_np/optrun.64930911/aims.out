* Unknown keyword periodic                                 in input file control.in.
* Please check the syntax of this keyword - is it a typo?
* If this is a valid keyword that was just introduced to the code,
* please also make sure that the keyword is listed in subroutine parse_control()
* in the dimensions.f90 module.
* Stopping the code for now.
